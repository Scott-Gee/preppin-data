For week 11, the most difficult thing is splitting out the cocktails recipes in to separate rows and splitting the ingredient and the measure in to separate columns.

In R you can use `separate_rows` to split a column in to separate rows like the example below. You can also `separate` a column in to separate columns on a separator.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

example <- tibble(x = c(1,2), 
                  y = c('a.b,d.c', 'e.d,f.g'))

example 

example_1 <- separate_rows(example, y, sep = ",") 

example_1 

example_2 <- separate(example_1, y, into = c('a','b'))

example_2
```

After this you should be able to join the datasets together and create new columns with some basic calculations
