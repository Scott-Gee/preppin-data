For the first week you'll need to be able to:

- read data in with the `readxl` package
- split a column on a separator with the [`separate`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/separate.html) function 
- clean up a column with [`case_when`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/case_when.html) and [`str_starts`](rdocumentation.org/packages/stringr/versions/1.4.0/topics/str_starts)
- The `quarter` and 'day' functions in `lubridate`
- Output this as a CSV
