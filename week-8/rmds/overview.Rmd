This is again quite a bit harder than previous week. 

There are hints within the solutions that you can look at.


For the final part a rolling join needs to be done (join to nearest value). This is not possible in the `tidyverse` R packages. Instead data.table will be used. Data.table is a different syntax to write code but is really fast and memory efficient. 

Have a look at some guides on how to use data.table [here](https://atrebas.github.io/post/2020-06-17-datatable-introduction/)
