For this week there are lots of calculations to be done which can be done with `dplyr` and the `mutate`, `group_by` and `summarise` functions.

Consider `group_by` to be the same as the SQL `GROUP BY`, `summarise` to be the same as `SUM` and `mutate` will create new columns from current columns in the dataframe.

In question 1 you'll need to remove things from a string field. This can be done really efficiently by extracting the characters you want to keep with [`str_extract`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stringr/versions/1.4.0/topics/str_extract)

Before outputting, you need to round all values to one decimal place. This can be done using `across` in `dplyr` like [this](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/across.html) tutorial (towards bottom of the page)
