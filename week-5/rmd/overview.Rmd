This week is more challenging than the recent 4 weeks and looks at updating old data and removing duplicates.

When looking at this week, it may be helpful to use a bit of code like the below to get the latest version of something.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
dataframe %>% 
  group_by(important_column) %>% 
  filter(some_date = max(some_date))
```

I found it easiest to join the tables together with `inner_join` on specific columns and then removing the columns that weren't needed.
